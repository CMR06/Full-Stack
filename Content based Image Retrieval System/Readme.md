1.0 Introduction:
The Image Retrieval GUI is a tool made to retrieve images that have similarities from databases. The functions of the program, how to use it, detailed instructions, and more analyses are covered in this paper.
1.1 Running the Program:
The following are steps to run the Program:

•	Ensure you have Python installed and running.
•	Unzip the file with the name “Submission Assignment-4” to the local directory. 
•	Open the “Submission Assignment-4” and open “Video_Shot_Boundary_Detection_System.EXE” file.
•	The Zip file contains the. EXE, sample image folders, cache folder and Report.
•	If (Windows Defender blocks the file execution) 
1.	Click on the blocked notification from the panel and opt to provide exclusion to the folder path.
2.	Else go to “Windows Defender” settings and click on “Virus and Threat Protection settings”. Scroll down and select “Exclusions” and add the file by browsing on the local drive.

1.2 Step-by-Step Guidelines:
•	After running the .EXE file the GUI window will pop up.
•	Click on an image to enlarge that selected image and it will show up in the image viewer on the left.
•	Click the dropdown button below to select any retrieval method for the images(“Intensity”,”Color”,”Color + Intensity”).
•	Now, click the “Retrieve Images” button below to sort the images based on selected retrieval method.
•	After clicking on “Retrieve Images” buttons the relevant images will be displayed on the right within a frame.
•	To browse the images in the GUI click on the paginator below the images tab. All the sorted images would be ordered in Ascending order from most similar retrieved image to least similar retrieved image after clicking on any of the retrieve buttons.
•	Use the “Reset” button to revert to default images.
•	If user want to enhance the retrieval algorithm by providing user input, this can be done by selecting the Relevance checkbox on the left. 
•	The Relevance Feedback option is only available when you choose “Color + Intensity” method.
•	After clicking on “Relevance” option additional checkboxes will appear after the image number to select any for the user.
•	Then User need to click on retrieve button to retrieve all the images with “Color + Intensity” method and user provided feedback images.
•	This process can be done multiple times until the user is satisfied with retrieved images.
•	Click “Close” to exit the program.
